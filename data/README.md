As of this file, all of this are recordings from a single sensor, located
on A#0. The "interference" files are produced by leaving A#0 alone, and
tapping the keys A0 and B0. The non-intereference files are of course,
from striking A#0.

The filenames go something like:

* timestamp
* ADC
* VDD
* VAA
* approx sample rate
* current to voltage conversion device
* gain-setting resistor value
* Vref source and voltage

TIAs flip the signal around, so that 1023-x (where x is any given data point)
produces the expected signal.
